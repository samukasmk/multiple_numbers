# Installing

## External tools

This project requires some external tools like: `git`, `docker`, and `docker-compose`.

If you don't have some of those external tools mentioned. You should read these articles:
- [How to install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [How to install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [How to install Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)


## Cloning this project

```
git clone https://github.com/samukasmk/multiple_numbers.git
```

## Building docker image

```sh
docker-compose build multiple-numbers
```

# Running

## Running by docker-compose
After `git` project was cloned and the `docker` image was built successfully, to run the python script by docker-compose is just the simple command below:

```sh
docker-compose run multiple-numbers
Creating multiple_numbers_multiple-numbers_run ... done
```

The script by default will start detecting multiples of 3 and 5, within a number from 1 to 100:
```sh

## Displaying other options
But you can display other argument options with `--help` to run with other parameters:


```sh
$ docker-compose run multiple-numbers --help
Creating multiple_numbers_multiple-numbers_run ... done
```

```sh
usage: multiple-numbers [-h] [-m [MULTIPLICABLES ...]] [-i INITIAL_NUMBER] [-f FINAL_NUMBER]

A command line tools that tells if is multiple numbers.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -m [MULTIPLICABLES ...], --multiplicables [MULTIPLICABLES ...]
                        The multiplicable numbers to do the detections.
  -i FIRST_NUMBER, --first-number FIRST_NUMBER
                        The initial number to start the iteration
  -f LAST_NUMBER, --last-number LAST_NUMBER
                        The final number to start the iteration
```

## Running with different arguments

```sh
$ docker-compose run multiple-numbers --first-number 1 --last-number 10 --multiplicables 2 4 6
Creating multiple_numbers_multiple-numbers_run ... done
```

```sh
1

```


# Testing

To run unit tests by docker-compose previous defined, just execute the simple command:

```sh
docker-compose run tests
```

```sh
