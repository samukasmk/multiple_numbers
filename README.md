## Installing

### External tools

This project requires of some external tools to be installed like `git`, `docker`, and `docker-compose`.

If you don't have external tools installed like mentioned before. You should to consider read this documents:
- [How to install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [How to install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [How to install Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)


### Cloning this project

```
git clone https://github.com/samukasmk/multiple_numbers.git
```

### Building docker image

```sh
docker-compose build multiple-numbers
```

## Running

### Running by docker-compose
After git project was cloned and the `docker` image was builded successfuly, to run the python script by docker-compose is just the simple command bellow:

```sh
docker-compose run multiple-numbers
Creating multiple_numbers_multiple-numbers_run ... done
```

The script by default will start detecting multiples of 3 and 5, within a number from 1 to 100:
```sh

### Displaying other options
But you can choose other options to display with `--help` argument:


```sh
$ docker-compose run multiple-numbers --help
Creating multiple_numbers_multiple-numbers_run ... done
```

```sh
usage: multiple-numbers [-h] [-m [MULTIPLICABLES ...]] [-i INITIAL_NUMBER] [-f FINAL_NUMBER]

A command line tools that tells if is multiple numbers.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -m [MULTIPLICABLES ...], --multiplicables [MULTIPLICABLES ...]
                        The multiplicable numbers to do the detections.
  -i FIRST_NUMBER, --first-number FIRST_NUMBER
                        The initial number to start the iteration
  -f LAST_NUMBER, --last-number LAST_NUMBER
                        The final number to start the iteration
```

### Running with different arguments

```sh
$ docker-compose run multiple-numbers --first-number 1 --last-number 10 --multiplicables 2 4 6
Creating multiple_numbers_multiple-numbers_run ... done
```

```sh
1
Two

TwoFour
5
TwoSix

TwoFour
9

```


## Testing

To execute unit tests previous defined by docker-compose is just the simple command bellow:

```sh
docker-compose run tests
```

```sh
Creating multiple_numbers_tests_run ... done
test_multiplicables_by_three_and_five (test_detects_multiplicable_numbers.TestDetectsMultiplicableNumbers.test_multiplicables_by_three_and_five) ... ok

## Using as a library 

You can install this project like a package in your virtualenv using git url:

```sh
pip install -e git+https://github.com/samukasmk/multiple_numbers.git@v0.1.4#egg=multiple_numbers
```

And then you can use in your script like:

```python
from multiple_numbers import is_multiplicable

for n in range(1, 11):
    by_three = '' if is_multiplicable(n, 3) else 'not '
    by_five = '' if is_multiplicable(n, 5) else 'not '
    print(f'{n} -> is ({by_three}multiplicable by 3) and ({by_five}multiplicable by 5)')
```

```
1 -> is (not multiplicable by 3) and (not multiplicable by 5)
2 -> is (not multiplicable by 3) and (not multiplicable by 5)
3 -> is (multiplicable by 3) and (not multiplicable by 5)
4 -> is (not multiplicable by 3) and (not multiplicable by 5)
5 -> is (not multiplicable by 3) and (multiplicable by 5)
6 -> is (multiplicable by 3) and (not multiplicable by 5)
7 -> is (not multiplicable by 3) and (not multiplicable by 5)
8 -> is (not multiplicable by 3) and (not multiplicable by 5)
9 -> is (multiplicable by 3) and (not multiplicable by 5)
10 -> is (not multiplicable by 3) and (multiplicable by 5)
```

Or run the script installed directly in command line:

```sh
multiple-numbers
